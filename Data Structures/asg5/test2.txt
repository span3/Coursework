This is a simple file of test data to test the Huffman encoding
program.  the file with the extension .coding and the same
prefix as this file is the output from the file.

Note that very frequently occurring letters have short encoding
strings and that very rarely occurring letters have much longer
encoding strings.  The space character occurs most frequently
and thus has the shortest code, and is printed as \x20.  The
newline character occurs invisibly at the end of every line and
is printed in hexadecimal as \x0A.  There are no carriage return
characters in the file.

In English, the letters listed in decreasing frequency order are
etoain shrdlu.  so if you need to buy a vowel, buy ``e''.  And
``t'' occurs more frquently than any other consonant.  This is
statistically true of English, of course, but not necessarily
true of any particular document.
