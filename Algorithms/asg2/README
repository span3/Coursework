Programming Assignment #2

Compile the program by entering make, which will compile the program using the Makefile supplied.
Attached are test.data, test2.data and test3.data, each of which test various cases of graphs.
test.data is a simple cycle, whereas test2.data and test3.data contain more bad edges and multiple
vertices.

The program returns segmentation faults, which I was unable to find the source of.  However, I
have went through my algorithms multiple times, and am quite confident that they are correct.
