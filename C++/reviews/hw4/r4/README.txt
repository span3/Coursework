What I Learned

When approaching Assignment 3 from Assignment 2 I had just added code to the file
this resulted in one very long file with alot of class information in it. Some of 
the feedback that I recieved suggested I split this code into separate files which
I proceeded to do before starting the project. I also took the oppertunity to thin 
out some of the functions that I would not need in this assignment for example I 
removed the Prims Functions as I could not see myself needing a Minimum Spanning 
tree for the Hex Game. As a result of this I feel my code is more readable.

Going through this assignment I have learnt the importance of adapting previous 
solutions to a new problem. Though much of the groundwork was there, I spent alot
of time on minor alterations to make things work. One of my big hinderances in 
this assignment has been the mathematics to make sure the board is a legal graph
and a legal board. However I am pleased to have got that working. I enjoyed being
able to build off previous work and adapt my path finding algorithm to see if 
the game has been won.

Over all I am pleased with the outcome of this Assignment.
